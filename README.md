# Self Reflection

Hello, my name is Wilson Johnson. I graduated from southern New Hampshire with a computer science degree on November 1st, 2018. 

Throughout my studies I studied various aspects of programming and the skills associated with it, such as integrating databases, web applications, Linux kernels, and many other various in-depth coding standards and techniques. 

I also developed some skills in the AGILE method of project management, and as such I have improved my professional skills working on projects in a team-based environment. 

Throughout my coursework, I was employed as an applications developer at McLane Corporation and I was able to use and develop the skills I learned about in a real work environment. This active use of skills allowed me to develop these skills more than what schoolwork alone could have done. Many times, much of the tooling I used at work transferred over to the tooling that was used or would eventually be used in my coursework. For example, at work, we use Maven, Spring, and Java EE to set up web applications, and for the Advanced Programming Concepts course final project, we had to utilize similar tooling to create a web servlet that handled HTTP requests to query a database. 

However, one of the things that I feel that the coursework fell short in was the diversity of programs languages and concepts, such as the differences between object and structured programming, which I have spent much of my free time researching. I am proficient in multiple programming languages, (C, C++, JavaScript, Haskell, java, PowerShell, bash, etc.) Therefore, I chose to do not only an enhancement of one of my previous final projects; advanced programming concepts, but to create an artifact from scratch to showcase my knowledge of different languages and frameworks. 

The first artifact I created, which is currently still in development, is a platforming game/engine. It is currently, at this point, just a simplified demo, but the final product will eventually be a full game with one level showing all the capabilities of the tools it uses. 

I chose this artifact because I have always wanted to make a game and had not been confident in my ability to do so until recently.

This artifact shows not only my ability in software design and engineering, but also my ability with algorithms and data structures. The software design and engineering portion is shown by being able to tie the multiple APIs and Frameworks that the application utilizes into one coherent application. A game has many different technologies at play and ensuring that these do not become a tangled mess is part of this aspect of computer science. 

To satisfy the Algorithms and Data structures portion, a similar mindset was taken. Many of these frameworks utilize vastly different data structures to pass around essentially the same data. An example of this is the physics engine and the rendering engine, both store position and object sizes, but they do it in vastly differing ways. I came up with a method of re-using these objects to speed up the communication between these disparate technologies. Since this needed to be executed every frame, they also needed to be highly performant, and as such, I took great care to keep these functions short and sweet.

The enhancement for databases was a simpler task, as I desired to improve upon the DAO API that I had created to have cleaner code for communicating with a MongoDB database. The purpose of this enhancement was to showcase my knowledge of MongoDB queries, and to create a simpler method for calling these aggregate queries in Java. This portion could also attribute to the Software Design and Engineering enhancements, as they greatly consider the method in which this would be utilized as an API.
